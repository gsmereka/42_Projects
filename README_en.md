## What is 42?

École 42 is a renowned programming school founded in France by Xavier Niel in 2013. It adopts a disruptive and innovative teaching methodology based on practical and collaborative learning.

Unlike traditional educational institutions, École 42 does not have teachers or formal classes. Instead, students learn primarily through practical projects and exchanges within the community. This approach encourages autonomy, critical thinking, and problem-solving.

## Education

The curriculum consists of a series of themed projects, individual or group-based, that students must progress through. Each project has its own challenges and goals to be achieved. Students must successfully complete each project before moving on to the next, ensuring progressive and solid learning.

Each project aims to teach fundamental concepts and explore important technologies used in software development. The following catalog covers a variety of programming topics approached in a practical manner.

### Phase 1 - Getting Into Orbit

The initial steps in the education, where most projects use the C language, and all projects are individual.

| Project | Description |
| --- | ---|
| **[Libft](https://github.com/gsmereka/Libtf)** | Libft is a C library of functions that can be easily used in any project. It contains replicas of functions already existing in the [standard C library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library). In many subsequent projects, we are required to use the Libft versions instead of the originals. |
| **[get_next_line](https://github.com/gsmereka/get_next_line)** | An additional function included in Libft, which aims to read lines from files efficiently. |
| **[ft_printf](https://github.com/gsmereka/ft_printf)** | A replica of the printf function, also included in Libft. |
| **[Born2BeRoot](https://github.com/gsmereka/born2beroot)** | An introduction to the use of virtual machines. We set up an SSH server and understand general system administration rules, password security, and more. |
| **[So_Long](https://github.com/gsmereka/So_long)** | A simple top-down style game using a simple graphics library implemented for 42, called [Minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux). |
| **[Pipex](https://github.com/gsmereka/Pipex)** | Pipex aims to simulate how the '\|' operator works in Linux processes. |

### Phase - 2 - Expanding Horizons

In this phase, we have access to the first group projects and the first extra challenge proposed by 42.

| Projeto | Descrição |
| --- | ---|
| **[push_swap](https://github.com/gsmereka/push_swap)** | A project aimed at understanding sorting algorithms. We must choose the best methods to sort a stack of random numbers using predefined operations.
| **[Minishell](https://github.com/gsmereka/Minishell)** | A simple and functional replica of the Bash shell used in Linux, also my first group project and the longest one so far. |
| **[Philosophers](https://github.com/gsmereka/Philosophers)** | A project focused on understanding the functioning of threads and solving [data races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) and [deadlocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock). |
| **[NetPractice](https://github.com/gsmereka/netpractice)** | An introduction to networks and IPv4 protocol, where we solve connection problems between networks and within networks. |
| **[Cub3d / MiniRT](https://github.com/gsmereka/minirt)** | My second graphics project and second group project. |
